# 🤖 Robotics & Autonomous Systems Learning Roadmap

## Overview
This repository documents my structured learning journey in robotics, autonomous systems, and intelligent control using Python. It serves as a transparent progress tracker, knowledge base, and proof of consistent engineering growth.

The goal is simple: **learn fundamentals the right way, build real systems, and evolve toward intelligent robotics software**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build strong foundations in robotics programming
- Understand sensor-based perception and decision-making
- Apply Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to real robot systems
- Progress from basic movement to intelligent autonomous behavior

---

## 🧭 Learning Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundations (Completed)
- ✅ Python basics for robotics
- ✅ Control flow and functions
- ✅ Time-based and sensor-triggered movement logic
- ✅ Basic robot motion simulation

### Phase 2: Sensor Integration (Completed)
- ✅ Ultrasonic sensor concepts
- ✅ Object detection logic
- ✅ Distance-based decision thresholds

### Phase 3: Obstacle Avoidance Logic (In Progress)
- 🔄 Detect obstacles in real time
- 🔄 Decide when to stop, turn, or reroute
- 🔄 Implement alternative movement paths

### Phase 4: Object-Oriented Design (Planned)
- ⏳ Refactor logic into classes
- ⏳ Create reusable robot components
- ⏳ Simulate real-world robot architecture

### Phase 5: Intelligent Control (Planned)
