# 👋 Hi, I’m Ayomikun

🚀 Robotics • AI • Software • Mechatronics-in-Progress

I’m a builder-first technologist focused on **robotics, autonomous systems, and intelligent software**. I believe in fundamentals before flash, systems before shortcuts, and learning by building.

## 🧠 What I’m Currently Building

* 🤖 Autonomous robot logic (Python)
* 📡 Sensor-based perception & obstacle avoidance
* 🧱 Modular, OOP-driven robot architectures
* 🛠️ Clean, scalable engineering habits

---

## 🗺️ Learning & Build Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundations ✅

* Python for robotics
* Control flow, timing, and motion logic
* Basic robot movement simulation

### Phase 2: Sensor Integration ✅

* Ultrasonic sensor concepts
* Distance-based object detection
* Real-time decision triggers

### Phase 3: Obstacle Avoidance 🔄

* Dynamic obstacle detection
* Alternative movement decisions
* Rerouting logic

### Phase 4: Object-Oriented Robotics ⏳

* Robot components as classes
* Reusable, modular architecture
* Real-world system simulation

### Phase 5: Intelligent Control ⏳

* Path optimization
* Introductory PID control
* Smarter autonomous behavior

---

## 🚧 Current Focus

* Turning raw logic into clean OOP systems
* Improving decision-making under constraints
* Writing code that mirrors real hardware behavior

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Languages:** Python, JavaScript (learning)
* **Concepts:** Robotics logic, OOP, control systems
* **Tools:** Git, GitHub, simulation-first development

---

## 📈 Milestones

* Built stable sensor detection logic
* Implemented basic obstacle response
* Progressing toward full autonomy

---

## 🎯 Long-Term Vision

I’m on a path toward **Mechatronics Engineering**, embedded systems, and intelligent machines that interact with the real world.

This profile will evolve — just like the systems I build.

> Consistency over hype. Fundamentals before flash.
